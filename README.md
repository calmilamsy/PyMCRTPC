# PyMCRTPC
Python Minecraft Resource to Texture Pack Converter.  
**Because I suck at names.**

### Features
- Takes any minecraft 1.6> resource pack.
- Puts any textures that exist in 1.4.7< into various stitched texture files.
- These can then be used as a texturepack for 1.4.7<.  

Thats it.

### Caveats
- Anything other than 16x16 resourcepacks are not supported!
- 1.5.* is not supported due to wierd texture madness.
- If you want to convert a texturepack into a resourcepack, you will want to use [TextureEnder](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/utilities/TextureEnder.jar).

### Requirements
- Python 3 or above.
- A toaster that doesnt overheat.
- 10 minutes of time.
